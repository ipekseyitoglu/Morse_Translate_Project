Morse code is a method of encoding text characters as sequences of dots and dashes (or short and long signals) for the purpose of transmitting information. It was developed by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail in the early 1830s and later improved by various contributors. Morse code was widely used for long-distance communication before the advent of modern telecommunications systems.

In Morse code, each letter, numeral, or punctuation mark is represented by a unique combination of short signals (dots) and long signals (dashes). The code is based on a simple concept: the most frequently used letters and characters have shorter codes, while less common ones have longer codes. This design minimizes the time required to transmit frequently used symbols.

Morse code can be transmitted using various methods, including flashing lights, sound signals (such as with a telegraph or Morse code key), or visual signals (like flags or semaphore). It played a significant role in early telecommunication, maritime communication, and military communication. While it's no longer widely used for practical purposes, Morse code remains an interesting part of history and is sometimes still taught and used by amateur radio operators and enthusiasts for its historical and nostalgic value.
